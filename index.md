## [Bivariate Relationships](./homework-5.html)
For this assignment, you must select at least two variables of interest from your dataset, provide a basic description of the variables, clean and recode as needed, and present descriptive statistics and any visualizations. Your R Markdown document should include:

1. Descriptions of the variables - how they were collected, any missing values, etc
2. How you cleaned and coded the data, including a before/after comparison as needed
3. summary descriptives of the recoded variables
4. appropriate visualizations (not required)2. Description of the relationship between the variables, including a hypothesis (or hypotheses) about the relationship.
3. Initial demonstration of the relationship, which could include correlation, visualization, or statistical model.
4. (Optional Advanced) Try creating a function that will allow you to easily and accurately implement a repetitive recoding task. (If you are cutting and pasting, use a function!)
5. (Optional Advanced) If you are working on a model, play around with some of the visual diagnostic tools described in RDS.
